  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">About This App</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Practice over <strong>200 DVSA-style theory questions</strong>  ad-free, offline, and distraction-free.<br>
    Created by a dad and his son for learners across the UK.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-blue-600">ðŸ§° How It Started â€“ Why We Built This</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      When my son Ed started preparing for his theory test, we tried using the usual apps on the Play Store. But they all had something wrong:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Full Theory Question Bank</strong>  over 200 practice questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Mock Test Mode</strong>  Take randomized practice tests under exam conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Road Signs Gallery</strong>  Browse and learn from the complete UK sign library.</li>
      <li><strong>Road Sign Quiz</strong>  Test your visual knowledge of over 600 UK traffic signs.</li>
      <li><strong>Support Page</strong>  Optional donation and contact information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      We wanted something simpler. Something that just worked. So one weekend, with Ed at my side, I opened up Android Studio and started building our own version  fast, lightweight, clean, and totally offline.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      That one-weekend project has turned into something more: a real app, for real learners, that anyone can use.
